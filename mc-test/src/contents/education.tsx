              How have you developed new opportunities to include more people in
              shaping synthetic biology? Innovative educational tools and
              outreach activities have the ability to establish a two-way
              dialogue with new communities by discussing public values and the
              science behind synthetic biology. Document your approach and what
              was learned by everyone involved to compete for this award.
