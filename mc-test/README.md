# Team McMaster-Canada 2024 Wiki

This repository uses `TypeScript` and `React` to manage the wikis.

This repository **MUST** contain all coding assets to generate your team's wiki
(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc).

Images, photos, icons and fonts **MUST** be stored on `static.igem.wiki` using
[tools.igem.org](https://tools.igem.org), and Videos **must** be embedded
from [iGEM Video Universe](https://video.igem.org).

For up-to-date requirements, resources, help and guidance, visit
[competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki).

## Getting Started

Before refactoring the code of this template to suit your wiki needs, please make sure you have the ability to use React
for web development.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/mcmaster-canada
   cd mcmaster-canada
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   ### Important:

   Ensure you are using Node.js version `^18.18.0 or >=20.0.0` to mostly avoid compatibility issues. Node `v18.20.0` is
   recommended for this project. You can check your Node version by running `node -v` in your terminal.

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```
4. Navigate to the files you wish to edit:
   - The main App component can be found under `src/containers/App`
   - Pre-built components are located under `src/components`
   - Individual pages can be modified in the `src/pages.ts`
   - Content pages can be updated in the `src/contents`
5. Once you are done, save the changes by **committing** them to the _main branch_ of the repository
6. An automated script will build, test and deploy your wiki to the iGEM server
